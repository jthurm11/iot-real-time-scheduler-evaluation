In this file, I'm going to explain how to physically configure the ultrasonic sensor, breadboard, and raspberry pi.

Materials needed:
- Rasbperry pi
- HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- 8 male to female jumper wires (2 of each different color recommended)
- 1 K Ohm resistor
- 2 K Ohm resistor

Steps:
1. Plug a wire into the Vcc port of the ultrasonic sensor and the positive rail of the breadboard 
2. Next to that wire on the positive rail, plug in a wire and connect it to physical GPIO pin 2 on the RPi
3.
